##Intent

With our redesign of Craigslist, we wanted to deliver a more consistent and beautiful user experience while maintaining the utility that has made Craigslist successful throughout the past 20 years. To this end, we carefully selected page layouts, visual design elements, and animations that we believed embodied the company's community-centered philosophy.

##Visual Design

###Colors
We wanted to create a more aesthetically appealing version of Craigslist while still staying true to the brand identity. So we chose a purple color palette with accents of gray and yellow to highlight important information. Actions related to content creation and curation, such as posting and saving listings, are colored yellow as a call to action. Other important functionality, like search, is highlighted with darker purple to and differentiate it from content creation actions.

###Typography
The current version of Craigslist has only two fonts: Times New Roman and Arial. We wanted to make the Craigslist logo a serif font as a nod to the original logo in the upper left corner of the page. For the rest of the content, we chose Lato for its versatility and user friendliness. We believe that Lato embodies the Craigslist's versatile and community-centric identity.

##Views

###Navigation bar
Craigslist is mainly used to create and search local listings. We wanted these functionalities to be the most important parts of the site, so we placed them in the nav bar where they are always visible and easily accessible. We also placed user account info in the upper right corner of the nav bar for easy access to a user's account information. Ideally, clicking on the user's name would reveal a dropdown list with options to edit account info, change Craigslist location, see saved searches, and stay updated on the listings that the user has created or is following.

###Main View
When studying the main view of Craigslist, we realized that Craigslist's current homepage doesn't explicitly say what the website is for. Instead, the user is confronted with myriad links which show far too much detail about the website. This may be useful for an experienced user of the site, but it is intimidating for new and less experienced users of the site. We took the opportunity to introduce Craigslist's philosophy on the main page and turn the page into a hub of exploration and discovery, for those who don't already know what they want. Experienced users who already know what they want can immediately start searching or seeing their account information from the readily accessible nav bar.

This version of Craigslist has been localized to San Francisco because that's where Craigslist started. Details such as the background image on the splash page may change depending on the region.
